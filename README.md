**Summary:** 
This project is the (by)product of a bachelor thesis dealing with the development of an "AR-optimized Manufacturing-Assistant" system for the HoloLens 2.
This system was developed taking into account current findings and results from works that deals with the topic of AR in training,
assembly and maintenance tasks. 
The main purpose of this system is to guide a inexperienced user(i.e. a trainee of some kind) through a manuel assembly or maintenance task.
Additionally the system allows the HoloLens 2 sensors to record the user's hand and head movements. These recordings can late be visualized, for example 
with *this* program.




**Feature Overview:**

*Digital Twin:*
In its core-function AroMa uses a digital twin to show the current assembly step and highlights step-relevant parts by animating them in such a way that mounting 
position and direction are shown.

*Part Amount Indicator:*
It is possible, during the setup process, to designate part-bins, which are then, during asasembly,  highlightet and accompanied by numbers to indicate to the user what and how many parts are required 
for a given step.

*Proccess Indicator:*
During assembly the current assembly-step and the total amount of steps are shown close to the users right(per default, but can be changed) hand.

*Voice commands:*
Via the voice command "Next" the subsequent assembly step can be initiated.
